    Hello! So, yeah, <strong>commercial projects</strong>, I've had a few experiences with it, one succesful and one not so much, so, lets start with successful. <br>
    Succesful one is a Minecraft Geo-Political "POLITIME" (And yes, it's not inherently my project, but, I took part in it's history), so why is it successful? Cause the server is built around the "donate privileges", where you get early access to events, easier start/just playing the game (all the kits) and etc, and believe me - it's not purely cosmetic, and the donate swords - oh my! This is another art of P2W. <br>
    And then my project which I was leading single handedly, and I have such moral principle, that if there's any donate, that it's purely cosmetical, no OP swords, just the looks, and a few problems arisen <br>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Lack of interest.</strong> Believe it or not, I lacked the interest to do anything for the server after a few weeks. This resulted in planned systems not being written, and planned models - not being made.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of playerbase.</strong> With POLITIME, they've already had established playerbase, and sure, there were a few cavieats, such as, we got to "refund" our past members their donate privileges for like a month, but then, they started paying each month to keep their previleges, and <strong>this</strong> was their main money flow - they already had players who were ready to pay for such services.</li>
    </ol>
    And this is pretty much it, like, sure, this blog entry might seem more like crying than anything meaningful, but, it's my blog, so it is what it is.
